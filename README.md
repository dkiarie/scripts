# Scripts
I should really make a habit of keeping these...
## current scripts
- ttw (time to work!)
- ttp (time to play!)
- ttr (time to rebase?)
- setup_new_machine (WIP)
- top_commands
- weather

### ttr (time to rebase)
#### Description
Checks a git repository to see if a rebase with `origin/master` is necessary.
#### Useage
if you add the scripts directory to the PATH environment variable you just have
to do this.
`ttr <path_to_repo>`
